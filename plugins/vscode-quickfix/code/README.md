## Summary

This extension, within the API Scoring product, is meant to help developers to achieve the best API Certification grade in their APIs. Since the certification service retrieves principles, the book of best practices in the API ecosystem, the accomplishment of these rules is crucial to obtain the A+.

Since this extension is based on [Spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral), it uses its engine to lint possible errors/warnings retrieved from the API White Paper principles. Once linted, with just a click you could add/remove code in your API.
